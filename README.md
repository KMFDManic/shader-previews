# shader-previews
A repo to store thumbnail previews for RetroArch's many shaders.

Its directory structure mirrors the common-shaders and slang-shaders repos and it includes previews of the shader presets (i.e., not individual shaders unless they have an accompanying preset).

When possible, preview shots were created by opening the upscale-test image in RetroArch's built-in image-viewer core at 8x scale. Some shaders require additional settings or images to capture their effects and those are handled on a case-by-case basis. When additional settings are required, notes should be added to the preview.
